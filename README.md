# Fortnite-Database-Command-Line-App

This jar was made with java 11. 
This is a prerequisite "test" app that was made to ensure the database worked. The database was made with help from https://twitter.com/Snowfoot. 

This database shows the way various media is connected to the game "Fortnite." It was mostly a fun project with an idea I got from friends. 

TO RUN:
Download the .jar file and the .db file
Place the jar and db in a folder TOGETHER.

Open your terminal of choice, navigate to the folder (cd <folder> on Windows)
"java -jar <name>.jar"
  

The app is now running! The app writes to command prompt, but I'm working on a GUI project. 
I need stars please star this
