# Fortnite-Database-Command-Line-App

This jar was made with java 11. 
This is a prerequisite "test" app that was made to ensure the database worked. The database was made with help from https://twitter.com/Snowfoot. 

This database shows the way various media is connected to the game "Fortnite." It was mostly a fun project with an idea I got from friends. 

TO RUN:
Download the .jar file and the .db file
Place the jar and db in a folder TOGETHER.

Open your terminal of choice, navigate to the folder (cd <folder> on Windows)
"java -jar <name>.jar"
  
The way the database displays connections may cause confusion. 
The source image displays games as the crossovers that cause them to connect to Fortnite.
For example, entry 49: "Forza" has crossed over with Fallout, which has crossed over with Rocket League, which is directly related to Fortnite.
Connections are displayed as a list, but remember to go left to right, and read as seperate crossovers, reaching fortnite at the right.
  

The app is now running! The app writes to command prompt, but I'm working on a GUI project. 
I need stars please star this
